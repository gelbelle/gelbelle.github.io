Commune with nature until the sun comes up
It feels balanced to me
Get camp cleaned up, Roach hidden, tack hidden
Ask Roach to stay nearby
Bubba and I set off up the trail
I’m keeping an eye out for traps, but not super closely because there weren’t any last time
I’m asking Bubba what to expect inside
I linger in the edge of the trees until I get answers from Bubba

Clang the Bug Bear with a small stack of javelins beside him

Guy with spider thing on his shoulder
Dark skin, white hair, mean looking, angry that Gundren was hurt so bad

Symbol of Rising Moon on supplies

Long rest with Celdar then transport stuff down to the wagon
