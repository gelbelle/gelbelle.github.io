<p>We travelled uneventfully along the road to <em class="location">Phandalin</em>
until we reached two horses dead in the middle of the road. We were ambushed by 6 goblins. We know one of the horses belonged to Gundren, the dwarf that hired us to take the cart.</p>

<p>We fought the goblins and killed all but one of them. Yenna, the sorceress asked the goblin questions, telling him that we wouldn’t kill him if he gave us answers. Once we got information about the hideout up the trail Mykiel suggested we take the Paladin up the trail while Erak Vardin, the wizard, took care of “securin”g the goblin so he couldn’t get away.</p>

<p>Rainee Riverwood, the druid, had some sort of crisis and killed the goblin by stabbing it in the throat, saying that way it would be painless. We were all stunned.</p>

<p>We proceeded up the trail with Mykiel in the front. He found two traps along the way and we navigated them successfully. We gathered at the top of the trail beside a small stream that issued from the mouth of a cave that we presumed to be the hideout.</p>
