I heal him
He scouted the cave
Big spiders in there with blindvision
I give him the sausages

Bubba can talk to him and tells me he’s waiting for someone and asks if the horse belongs to me
I tell Bubba to tell Roach that I would be coming back to the town after we’re done
We get to the spot on the road, it’s 6 pm
I set up camp and change into wolf form to hunt
A strige is above me in a tree looking for prey, it hasn’t seen me yet
Bubba recommends a crossbow
There are 4 of them
I kill them with moonbeam
Bubba had caught 3 rabbits
We cooked and ate them</p>

<p>2-3 minutes after we settle into sleep Bubba tells me to shush and a big shadow crosses the moon. It was a green dragon.
He doesn’t like the coloured ones, says they’re mean spirited and dumb
The gold ones are honest and will stick to a deal, silver ones kinda, green ones are just liars and mean.
We go to sleep</p>
