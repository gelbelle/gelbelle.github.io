<p>6:00 am</p>

<p>As soon as Barthen’s opens at 6am I head up there to get an extra canteen for Roach and 7 days of oats. The canteen is 2L and costs 1s. It costs me 4S 1C. I have a nice breakfast of porridge, fruit, and bacon.</p>

<p>At 6:30 Walker comes down, eats a berry and sits with me. She gets a cup of tea while I finish eating. Buba settles down on my shoulder munching something. He makes a joke and I respond in my head. No outward signs of my conversation with Buba.</p>

<p>Walker asks me what I fight with. I reply, “my quarterstaff and darts”. She asks about my dagger, I had forgotten about it. She says she fights with the swords when needed, otherwise she can’t show me inside. She also has a dagger that appears and disappears in her gauntlet.</p>

<p>She calls Pip to fetch her horse. I ask for Roach too. He tips a fake hat. I stand up and Walker puts a couple of silver on the table and gives the wife a silver for pip. She goes outside and the horses are there. I follow her out. She has a 6”x4” half circle cut out of the saddled infront of where her knee would be.</p>

<p>Pip is there holding the reins. I give him 2C. Something grabs me by the back and lifts me into the saddle. It was Buba. I compliment him on his strength. We head to the Triboar Trail and head East. Buba tells me he can hear her heartbeat so she’s not dead/undead. If I wanted him to detect magic she would know if she was actively detecting magic.</p>

<p>We travel uneventfully until noon. Buba spots a creek ahead that we can water the horses at. It’s been about 30 miles. We unsaddle our horses, she brushes hers and I take Roach down to the river and brush her while she’s drinking. Then I give her an apple and her oats. Walker says that her horse wouldn’t really want that right now, but asks if I have some venison.</p>

<p>I start the fire while she pulls out a small tent and sets up her bedroll in it. She gives me a goodberry and says she doesn’t want a potato. She brews some tea then pulls out her book and a camp chair. She gives me one too. I meditate on nature.</p>

<p>After about 2 hours of reading, at about 7:30, she snaps her fingers and a little ball of light appears, it’s blue. It hovers above the fire. She sits cross legged on the ground and meditates. I visit Roach and walk down to the water. After 2 hours, at 9:30, she gets up. She pats her horse and whispers to him then says she’s going to bed. She says keeping watch isn’t necessary, the blue light is a ward that extends around the camp. Buba says he’s seen the pointy hats do them. He goes out and says it’s totally good.</p>

<p>Before crawling into her tent, Walker pulls out two bone handles with pieces of metal at the end. She looks at her gauntlet and uses the bone handle on it in a couple of spots then goes to bed. I crawl into my bedroll by the fire.</p>

<p>I usually wake up with the sun, but I want to wake up about 6 because I think I need to be with her. I wake up before the sun, but Walker is already up and has started the fire and saddled the horses. There’s eggs cooking on the fire. She says we can go after I eat. I ask if she’s eaten, she has and I gobble up the eggs. She conjures a dragon fruit and I offer it up to Buba. He’s a little suspicious, but he smells it and it smells fresh so he eats it. He wants more.</p>

<p>We head out at sunrise, about 7. It’s about 10, Buba tells me there’s a stream to the right nearby. I let Walker know and we head to the river on foot. As we walk towards the water Walker starts smelling the air so I tongue smell it. It doesn’t smell good. We look at each other and say, “ghouls”. Thinking out loud she says, “ghouls are nocturnal” and says we probably have a choice of whether we want to fight them or not. I vote to fight them because they are an undead creature and that is counter to the balance of nature. I know that Ghouls aren’t “tough”, but tough enough. They have multiple attacks per round. They cannot be poisoned.</p>

<p>We head down a path, there are three openings in the side of the hill beside us. In front of us there is a cave entrance. From the opening we can see a number of creatures in there and the smell confirms it is ghouls. There might be 5 or 6 that we can see, but there could be more in the background. She says they appear to be sleeping, what do you want to do. I want to investigate the holes on the side first. I do so in order.</p>

<p>It’s very dark and when I attempt to see in the first cave I trigger initiative. A giant spider sprays web at me, but I dodge out of the way and I hear a very loud roar. I cast wind wall across the entrance to the cave to keep the ghouls off our back while we deal with the spiders.</p>

<p>Walker steps around me and shoots the attacking spider with her bow that materialized from her gauntlet. It liquifies the original spider and the one next to it. I hear a very loud sound from the cave, but I’ve never heard it before. One of the ghouls attempts to go through the wall. He takes half damage. He closes on Walker, but he misses her with both his attacks. I throw a dart at the last spider. He sprays me with webbing, but I can break out of it.</p>

<p>A non-corporeal creature comes running out of the cave. He roars and I’m frightened. I run away. In four rounds Buba will dispel magic on me and I can come back. From a distance I hear a thunderclap. When I free to do so I sprint back. Walker dealt with everything on her own. There is a pile of ash beside her and she pulls something out of it and puts in her pocket. She asks me if I’m okay and tells me it’s alright when I apologize.</p>

<p>“So, did these guys have anything good on them?” She said that ghouls don’t often have much on them, but they might have something from other adventurers. Nassira knows that the ghouls wouldn’t likely be holding anything on them. I venture deeper into the cave. There are some rotting boxes in the back of the cave. In box number one there is 24G of ancient or foreign currency I’ve never seen, everything else is dust. In box number two there are 6P, 18G and nothing else. The next box has 24P, a dark green glass bottle with a liquid in it, the last box contains 18P. I tell her what I found. She asks to see one of the coins. She says they’re really old, from the Barzan Empire fell about 3500 years ago. She thinks I may get more for them than they’re worth.</p>

<p>She has a gash on her arm, but doesn’t take my offered healing. It’s early afternoon when we resume our journey. We’re following a path that winds around the foothills. I suggest we stop for the night and get an early start. We stop to make camp when we’re about two hours away.</p>

<p>When we sit she asks me about myself. I get her talking about the encounter. She explains what a Whyte is, she says it’s an extraplanar creature that was likely conjured to project something that has likely long rotted away. “Wow, how boring would that be?”. She pulls out her book to read and our camp chairs. She reads for about 75 minutes then meditates again. I gaze at the stars and get lots in their beauty. She meditates for 50 minutes. She conjures a piece of dragon fruit for Buba again. I take it and instantly it’s gone.</p>

<p>She asks me if I like music. I mention that I haven’t played my flute in awhile. It’s terrible and I put my flute away and crawl into bed. Walker pulls out a lute thing that does not have a curled neck. It’s amazing. She plays and sings an elven song. The version of elvish sounds weird to me. She seems to have a 5-6 octave range. She wishes me goodnight, offers me a tent, and goes to bed. It takes me about an hour to fall asleep. I had a rough day and I’m unhappy.</p>

<p>About two hours after I fall asleep I’m woken by a loud sound with a hand over my mouth. It’s Walker. She shushes me. I see a shape go over me, but I can’t make it out. I ask Buba if it’s the dragon again. He says this one is bigger and it’s red. The first one was young and green. Buba doesn’t know what’s going on. She apologizes for touching me, but says that sometimes dragons of that age can see through them. I say it’s no problem I was just glad she spotted it. She offered to teach me the ward spell if I liked. I demure.</p>

<p>She asks if she can give me something. I ask her what she means. She puts a small pin on my cloak. It will alert me if anything approaches the ward or anything super strong, evil, or planar comes within 3 miles max will trigger it.</p>

<p>I wake up at 5:20. I stow my bedroll near my saddle, start the fire and look for some eggs. I find a nest with 3 large bluebird eggs in it. I make eggs, pan fries with onions, and salt and pepper. Buba brings a rabbit. I roast the rabbit. Walker gets up, looks the same as she did the night before. I offer her breakfast, she thinks about it and then accepts. She pulls out plates and cutlery. She gives the horses a good berry. I serve up breakfast for everyone.</p>

<p>She conjures a dragon fruit for Buba. I say I need to learn that one, not the ward. She says it’s super easy, you just need to know where the tree is and reach through. I realize it’s not as easy as she seems to think. We finish and she cleans the plates. I take the rabbit skin.</p>
