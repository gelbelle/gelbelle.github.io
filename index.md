Coder extraordinaire in the making.

I am a dichotomy of design and geekery. From a young age I've been fascinated by computers and I've completed thousands of hours of training: through school and by myself. The only rival to tech in my life has been art. I received my first camera as a child and have pursued this with equal passion to coding. In addition to photography, I am a graphic, webpage, and software designer. As soon as I designed my first program, an education game for a school project, I knew that this was something I wanted to pursue. I got to combine my love of backend, frontend, and my work with children into one happy bundle.
